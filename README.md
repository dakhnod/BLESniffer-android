# BLESniffer-android

this xposed module needs no be installed on a phone with the target app.
It hooks into every app and outputs all BLE traffic through logcat.

The logcat may be viewed manually, but I also created [a python counterpart](https://github.com/dakhnod/BLESniffer-python) that allows
creating quick decoders and parsers without reinstalling any android apps.
